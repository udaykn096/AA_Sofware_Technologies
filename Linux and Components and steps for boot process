What is Linux?
Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. It acts as an interface between hardware and software, allowing programs to run, manage resources, and communicate with hardware devices.
It is widely used in servers, embedded systems, desktops, mobile devices (like Android), and cloud infrastructure.

üß© Components of Linux Operating System
Linux is made up of several key components, each responsible for different aspects of system functionality:
________________________________________
1. Kernel (Core of Linux)
‚Ä¢	Function: Manages system resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.).
‚Ä¢	Acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
‚Ä¢	Types:
o	Monolithic Kernel: Everything runs in one space (Linux uses this).
‚Ä¢	Manages:
o	Process scheduling
o	Memory management
o	Device drivers
o	System calls
________________________________________
2. System Libraries
‚Ä¢	Special functions/programs used by applications to interact with the kernel.
‚Ä¢	glibc is the most common system library in Linux.
‚Ä¢	Examples:
o	libc.so: C standard library
o	libm.so: Math library
________________________________________
3. System Utilities
‚Ä¢	Essential tools and commands used to manage the system.
‚Ä¢	Examples:
o	ls, cp, mv, ps, top, kill, chmod, df, du, etc.
‚Ä¢	These allow users and admins to interact with the system effectively.
________________________________________
4. Shell (Command Line Interface)
‚Ä¢	Acts as an interface between user and kernel.
‚Ä¢	Users type commands, which the shell interprets and sends to the kernel.
‚Ä¢	Types:
o	Bash (Bourne Again SHell) ‚Äì most common
o	Zsh, Ksh, Tcsh, Fish, etc.
________________________________________
5. Hardware Layer
‚Ä¢	Physical components: CPU, RAM, HDD/SSD, network cards, etc.
‚Ä¢	Managed entirely by the kernel through device drivers.
________________________________________
6. User Applications
‚Ä¢	Programs run by users: text editors, browsers, compilers, media players, etc.
‚Ä¢	Examples:
o	vim, firefox, gcc, gimp, docker, etc.
________________________________________
Optional: Init System
‚Ä¢	Responsible for bootstrapping the user space and managing services/daemons.
‚Ä¢	Examples:
o	Systemd, SysVinit, Upstart

Linux Boot Process :

The Linux boot process consists of several stages that culminate in a running system. Below are the key stages with a focus on the kernel and process handling:
________________________________________
üß± 1. BIOS/UEFI Stage
‚Ä¢	BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI initializes hardware.
‚Ä¢	Loads the bootloader (like GRUB) from the MBR (Master Boot Record) or EFI partition.
________________________________________
üßπ 2. Bootloader Stage (e.g., GRUB)
‚Ä¢	GRUB locates and loads the Linux kernel (vmlinuz) and initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) into memory.
‚Ä¢	Passes control to the kernel with parameters (e.g., root filesystem path).
________________________________________
üß† 3. Kernel Initialization
Once the bootloader loads the kernel, here's what happens:
a. Decompression and Setup
‚Ä¢	vmlinuz is a compressed kernel image ‚Üí it decompresses itself in memory.
‚Ä¢	Kernel sets up protected mode, memory management, and hardware abstraction.
b. Initramfs or Initrd Execution
‚Ä¢	Temporary root filesystem loaded into RAM.
‚Ä¢	Kernel mounts initramfs and executes /init inside it (a shell script or binary).
‚Ä¢	Responsible for:
o	Loading necessary drivers/modules.
o	Mounting the actual root filesystem (e.g., /dev/sda2).
________________________________________
üöÄ 4. Switch to Real Root Filesystem
‚Ä¢	Kernel executes a switch from initramfs to the real root filesystem.
‚Ä¢	Unmounts initramfs, mounts real /.
________________________________________
üîÅ 5. Starting init Process (PID 1)
‚Ä¢	The kernel executes the first user-space process: init.
‚Ä¢	This is the parent of all user-space processes.
Depending on the Linux distro, init could be:
‚Ä¢	System V init (/sbin/init)
‚Ä¢	Systemd (/lib/systemd/systemd)
‚Ä¢	Upstart (older Ubuntu)
________________________________________
üìã 6. Init/Systemd Process Responsibilities
‚Ä¢	Mounts essential filesystems like /proc, /sys, /dev.
‚Ä¢	Spawns services/daemons as defined in runlevels or systemd targets.
‚Ä¢	Starts getty on terminals for user login.
‚Ä¢	Starts networking, cron, dbus, etc.
________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è 7. Kernel Process Management
‚Ä¢	Kernel always has several internal processes, usually kernel threads:
o	kthreadd: Kernel thread manager.
o	ksoftirqd: Handles soft IRQs.
o	kworker: Manages background work queues.
o	kswapd: Handles memory swapping.
o	rcu_sched: Read-copy-update synchronization.
‚Ä¢	You can see them in top, ps, or /proc.
